            Happy Birthday Nafisha!
<p>
Sorry I don't have much for your birthday, but I wanna wish you a very happy birthday nonetheless. Especially to my favorite girl in the world! I just wanna say that you mean a lot to me even before "Us" happened. You were and are a great friend to me, a ray of light in a dark cave. Every time I hang out with you, time seems to fly at light speed. Your very warm presence fills me with warmth that I have never experience before. Your laughter gives me such joy that it makes me want to be even funnier around you. You're such a special person and you should remember that till you die. So yeah, you mean a lot to me :p. Hope you have a great rest of day, week, month, year, I don't care, just wish you the best of luck!

    P.S. I might add stuff to this that you should check out tomorrow night
